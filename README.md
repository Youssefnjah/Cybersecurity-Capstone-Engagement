# Cybersecurity Capstone Engagement

In this project I played the role of a pentester and SOC analyst. I set up Metric and File Beats on the vulnerable machine to log attacks for later analyzation. I started exploiting the machine. I then used Kibana to analyze the log attacks and created reports and visualization and then used them to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I discovered. All my work on this project can be summarized in this ![Google Presentation](https://github.com/Youssefnjah/Cybersecurity-Capstone-Engagement/blob/main/Capstone%20Engagement.pdf)

# Accomplishments

- Set up File and Metric Beats in oreder to log and export attack logs
- Exploited the web server and gained access to sensitive information
- Analyzed and created visual reports on Kibana
- Prposed soulutions on how mitigate and patch vulnerabilities that I exploited
